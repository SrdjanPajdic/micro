        Micro is very simple 4KB client side single page application helper. It has no dependencies, so plain javascript that works across all browsers.
        Main purpose is to turn any "hard-reload" website to Ajax driven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_BLANK">SPA</a>.
        It fit's very fine with any client side libraries like bootstrap, materialize etc. But with dynamic sites too. It's environment agnostic and very suitable to ajaxify existing projects.<br><br> 
        
        Micro is combined from Router and Tpl modules.<br><br>

        <strong>Router</strong> is a client side module based on history api. That means you can use "pretty" links with your application by writing url's like
        <code class="language-markup">http://www.example.com/page/subpage</code>. <br><br> 


        <strong>Tpl</strong> module has features like
        <ul>
            <li>- Loading templates</li>
            <li>- Basic data tpl data forwarding</li>
            <li>- Enter animations</li>
        </ul>

        We will see in the last section and on examples page how you can easily combine templates with routes to created 
        smoth and user friendly single page website.
